# ShellKeeper üêö

A lightweight terminal session manager that gives you the persistence of GNU Screen or tmux, but with your terminal's native scrolling. Finally, you can have persistent sessions without giving up your scrollback buffer!

## The Problem

Traditional terminal multiplexers like GNU Screen and tmux are powerful, but they come with a significant limitation: they break your terminal's native scrolling. Instead of using your mouse wheel or trackpad naturally, you're forced to enter "copy mode" with arcane key combinations. This makes reviewing command output unnecessarily cumbersome.

## The Solution

ShellKeeper leverages `dtach` - a minimal program that only does session management without terminal emulation. Written in pure shell (Zsh) with no Python dependencies, ShellKeeper provides:

- ‚úÖ **Native terminal scrolling works perfectly** - Use your mouse wheel, trackpad, or scrollbar just like normal
- ‚úÖ **Persistent sessions** - Survive SSH disconnections, network issues, or accidental terminal closures  
- ‚úÖ **Minimal overhead** - No terminal emulation layer eating resources
- ‚úÖ **Simple commands** - Intuitive interface without the complexity of tmux/screen
- ‚úÖ **Automatic keepalive** - Prevents SSH timeouts with invisible background signals

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a session
sk new myproject

# List sessions
sk ls

# Attach to a session
sk myproject

# Detach from current session
# Press Ctrl+\ (NOT Ctrl+C which kills the session)

# Quick reconnect after disconnect
sk          # Attaches to most recent
sk last     # Explicitly attach to last session
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

ShellKeeper only requires `dtach` - no Python or other dependencies:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install dtach

# macOS  
brew install dtach

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install dtach

# From source
git clone https://github.com/crigler/dtach
cd dtach && ./configure && make && sudo make install
```

### Install ShellKeeper

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pangeon-LLC/ShellKeeper.git
cd ShellKeeper
```

2. Add to your PATH:
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"
```

3. Load convenient aliases (optional):
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc  
source $(pwd)/lib/shellkeeper-aliases.sh
```

4. Reload your shell:
```bash
exec $SHELL
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
sk new [name]     # Create new session (auto-named if no name given)
sk ls             # List all sessions
sk [name]         # Attach to named session
sk                # Attach to most recent session
sk kill [name]    # Terminate a session
sk rename [old] [new]  # Rename a session
sk clean          # Remove dead session sockets
```

### Detaching Safely

**IMPORTANT**: Always detach with `Ctrl+\` (Control + Backslash)
- `Ctrl+C` kills the entire session (and all processes in it)
- `Ctrl+\` safely detaches, leaving everything running

### SSH Workflow

Perfect for remote work that survives connection drops:

```bash
# SSH to your server
ssh myserver

# Start a ShellKeeper session
sk new work

# Do your work...
# If connection drops, just reconnect and:
sk work  # You're back exactly where you left off!
```

### Auto-reconnect on SSH

Add to your remote `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Auto-show sessions when SSH'ing in
source /path/to/ShellKeeper/lib/shellkeeper-aliases.sh
sk_auto  # Shows available sessions on SSH login
```

## Configuration

Configuration file: `~/.shellkeeper/config.json`

```json
{
  "default_shell": "/bin/bash",
  "socket_dir": "~/.shellkeeper/sessions",
  "show_status": true,
  "status_position": "bottom",
  "keepalive": {
    "enabled": true,
    "interval": 60
  }
}
```

### Keepalive Feature

ShellKeeper includes automatic keepalive to prevent SSH timeouts:
- Sends invisible signals every 60 seconds (configurable)
- No output or interference with your work
- Disable with: `"enabled": false` in config

## Why ShellKeeper?

### vs GNU Screen/tmux

| Feature | Screen/tmux | ShellKeeper |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Native scrolling | ‚ùå Requires copy mode | ‚úÖ Just works |
| Simple commands | ‚ùå Complex | ‚úÖ Intuitive |
| Resource usage | Heavy (full terminal emulator) | Minimal (just dtach) |
| Learning curve | Steep | Gentle |
| Persistent sessions | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

### vs No Session Manager

- **Never lose work to disconnections** - Network drops, SSH timeouts, accidental closures - your work persists
- **Context switching** - Jump between different projects/contexts instantly
- **Background processes** - Leave long-running commands without keeping terminal open

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Session Naming**: Use descriptive names like `frontend`, `backend`, `logs`
2. **Project Workflow**: Create a session per project: `sk new myapp-api`, `sk new myapp-frontend`  
3. **Monitoring**: Keep a `logs` session for `tail -f` commands
4. **Aliases**: The shellkeeper-aliases.sh file includes handy shortcuts:
   - `skl` = `sk last` (attach to most recent)
   - `skr` = `sk-reconnect` (interactive session picker)
   - `sks` = `sk ls` (list sessions)

## Troubleshooting

**"Session not found" error**
- The session may have ended. Check with `sk ls`

**Can't create new session**
- Ensure dtach is installed: `which dtach`
- Check permissions on `~/.shellkeeper/`

**Prompt doesn't show [sk:name]**
- Run the setup script: `./lib/setup-sk-prompt.sh`
- Or manually: `source sk-prompt` in your session

**Accidentally killed session with Ctrl+C**
- Unfortunately the session is gone. Remember: always use `Ctrl+\` to detach!
- Run `sk clean` to remove dead socket files

## How It Works

ShellKeeper is a Python wrapper around `dtach` that adds:

1. **Session Management**: Easy create/list/attach/kill operations
2. **Smart Defaults**: Auto-naming, last-session memory, session discovery
3. **Shell Integration**: Prompt modification, environment variables, aliases
4. **Keepalive**: Background process preventing timeouts
5. **Safety Features**: Socket cleanup, session verification, dependency checking

The magic is that dtach only handles process attachment/detachment - it doesn't touch your terminal emulation. Your terminal still renders everything, so scrolling, copy/paste, and all other native features work normally.
